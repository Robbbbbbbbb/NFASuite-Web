The visual style must closely resemble Apple marketing pages:

Large typography

Generous whitespace

Neutral color palette

Minimal borders and effects

Use system fonts only, relying on Apple’s native font stack.

Layouts must be:

Mobile-first

Responsive

Accessible without JavaScript

Animations must be subtle and optional (CSS-only).

Think "Apple"
