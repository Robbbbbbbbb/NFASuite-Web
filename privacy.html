    <h1>Privacy Policy for NFASuite</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: 12/20/25</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing NFASuite (“we”, “us”, “our”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy
      describes how NFASuite collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the NFASuite mobile application (the
      “App”).</p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>NFASuite does not collect or store any personal information about you, such as your name, email address, phone
        number, or other contact details.</p>
      <p>You may voluntarily provide certain information, for example if you contact support. That information is used
        only to respond to your inquiry and is not stored or shared beyond what is necessary to provide support.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. RevenueCat and In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>We use RevenueCat to handle receipt validation in the App. RevenueCat is a third-party service that processes
        purchase information on behalf of app developers.</p>
      <p>RevenueCat collects purchase history and information necessary to manage subscriptions and fulfill App
        functionality.</p>
      <p>RevenueCat may assign an anonymous identifier for your account within their system.</p>
      <p>NFASuite itself does not collect identifiers like email, name, or device IDs, nor do we send such identifiers
        to RevenueCat.</p>
      <p>You must disclose purchase and subscription collection in the App Store privacy details. RevenueCat does not
        collect sensitive user data, such as contact lists, browsing history, or diagnostic information, by default.</p>
      <p>For more on RevenueCat’s privacy practices, please see their privacy policy: <a
          href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Automatic Collection of Information</h2>
      <p>NFASuite does not automatically collect data such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Crash logs</li>
        <li>Any personal or device behavior data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unless you explicitly choose to provide information (e.g., contact support), your usage of the App remains
        entirely local to your device.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Third parties used solely for the operation of NFASuite may process data to the extent necessary to provide
        their services. These services may include:</p>
      <p><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (for managing purchases and subscriptions)</p>
      <p>We do not share personal data with third-party analytics, advertising networks, or marketing services.</p>
      <p>RevenueCat’s privacy practices can be reviewed directly at their privacy page: <a
          href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>Since NFASuite collects no personal information, we do not use your information for marketing, analytics, or
        any purpose other than providing the app’s core functionality.</p>
      <p>Any purchase data handled by RevenueCat is used solely to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Validate purchases</li>
        <li>Manage subscription access</li>
        <li>Provide entitlement status</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud</li>
      </ul>
      <p>RevenueCat does not provide us with personal identifiers when anonymous IDs are used.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Because NFASuite itself does not collect personal information, there is no user data stored by NFASuite.</p>
      <p>RevenueCat retains purchase data per their privacy practices, which may be necessary to manage subscriptions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Security</h2>
      <p>Although NFASuite does not collect personal information, we strive to protect any information you choose to
        provide (e.g., support requests). We implement reasonable safeguards to protect that information.</p>
      <p>Your device is responsible for protecting your biometric scans and other local data stored on device. We do not
        transmit or back up this content to external servers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>NFASuite is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information
        from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so
        that we can take appropriate steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify you of
        significant changes, and the effective date will be updated accordingly.</p>
