Privacy Policy for NFASuite

Effective Date: 12/20/25

Thank you for choosing NFASuite (“we”, “us”, “our”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how NFASuite collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the NFASuite mobile application (the “App”).

1. Information We Collect
1.1 Information You Provide

NFASuite does not collect or store any personal information about you, such as your name, email address, phone number, or other contact details.

You may voluntarily provide certain information, for example if you contact support. That information is used only to respond to your inquiry and is not stored or shared beyond what is necessary to provide support.

2. RevenueCat and In-App Purchases

We use RevenueCat to handle receipt validation in the App. RevenueCat is a third-party service that processes purchase information on behalf of app developers.

RevenueCat collects purchase history and information necessary to manage subscriptions and fulfill App functionality.

RevenueCat may assign an anonymous identifier for your account within their system.

NFASuite itself does not collect identifiers like email, name, or device IDs, nor do we send such identifiers to RevenueCat.

You must disclose purchase and subscription collection in the App Store privacy details. RevenueCat does not collect sensitive user data, such as contact lists, browsing history, or diagnostic information, by default.

3. Automatic Collection of Information

NFASuite does not automatically collect data such as:

Device identifiers or advertising IDs

Location data

Usage analytics

Crash logs

Any personal or device behavior data

Unless you explicitly choose to provide information (e.g., contact support), your usage of the App remains entirely local to your device.

4. Third-Party Services

Third parties used solely for the operation of NFASuite may process data to the extent necessary to provide their services. These services may include:

RevenueCat (for managing purchases and subscriptions)

We do not share personal data with third-party analytics, advertising networks, or marketing services.

5. How We Use Your Information

Since NFASuite collects no personal information, we do not use your information for marketing, analytics, or any purpose other than providing the app’s core functionality.

Any purchase data handled by RevenueCat is used solely to:

Validate purchases

Manage subscription access

Provide entitlement status

Prevent fraud

RevenueCat does not provide us with personal identifiers when anonymous IDs are used.

6. Data Retention

Because NFASuite itself does not collect personal information, there is no user data stored by NFASuite.

RevenueCat retains purchase data per their privacy practices, which may be necessary to manage subscriptions.

7. Security

Although NFASuite does not collect personal information, we strive to protect any information you choose to provide (e.g., support requests). We implement reasonable safeguards to protect that information.

Your device is responsible for protecting your biometric scans and other local data stored on device. We do not transmit or back up this content to external servers.

8. Children’s Privacy

NFASuite is not directed to children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate steps.

9. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy when necessary to reflect changes in our practices. We will notify you of significant changes, and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
